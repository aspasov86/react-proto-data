##This one is inspired by React Redux and React Context Provider
- I wanted to create a component which by wrapping the others can pass all it's state and methods to each
- In the end I created a Proto component (src/prototype/Proto.js)
- Proto can be used by extending it when creating a Store
- In that Store you can add state and setters
